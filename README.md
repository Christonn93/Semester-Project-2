## Project Brief

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

- [x] A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- [x] A registered user may log in
- [x] A registered user may logout
